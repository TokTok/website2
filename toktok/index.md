# Current focus

Focus means we work on a small set of projects (one or two at a time) and
concentrate all our work on getting those projects finished completely before
moving on to the next target.

Our current focus is:

-   Create a [full specification](spec.html) of the Tox protocol.
-   Create a free [reference
    implementation](https://github.com/TokTok/hs-toxcore) of that protocol.

# Contact us
