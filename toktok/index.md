# Current focus

Focus means we work on a small set of projects (one or two at a time) and
concentrate all our work on getting those projects finished completely before
moving on to the next target.

Our current focus is:

-   Create a [full specification](spec.html) of the Tox protocol.
-   Create a free [executable model](https://github.com/TokTok/hs-toxcore) of
    that protocol.
-   Slowly improve the existing Tox protocol
    [implementation](https://github.com/TokTok/c-toxcore) written in C. We
    build new releases with mostly cleanups, minor bugfixes, and small
    non-intrusive features.

A new implementation in Rust is [in progress](https://github.com/zetok/tox).
It evolves together with the model and is tested against the specification.

Neither the Tox protocol nor the implementation have undergone peer review,
and its exact security properties and network behaviour and not
well-understood, yet. We are actively working on improving that situation.
Until said peer review, Tox is not recommended for use cases that require
proven high assurance security.
